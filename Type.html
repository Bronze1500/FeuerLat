             resembling a small log cabin. This design creates a structure with good airflow,
              allowing for a steady and efficient burn. Here's how to build a Log Cabin Fire:</p>

                 also known as a controlled burn or prescribed burn,
                  is a deliberately set fire conducted under controlled conditions to manage vegetation, reduce wildfire risks,
                   and promote ecosystem health. This practice is commonly used in forestry, agriculture, and land management.

            <img src="Campfire_Types5.png" width="182" class="cam1"><p class="p2">
                If you're referring to a "long fire" in the context of a campfire or outdoor fire,
                 it may be a term used to describe a fire that extends over a relatively long area or has a linear shape.
                  Creating a long fire can be practical in certain situations,
                 such as providing warmth along a seating area or accommodating a larger group of people.</p>

                 from Native American practices and is particularly useful in windy conditions.
                 This method involves digging a hole in the ground to create a concealed fire pit with a connecting tunnel for increased airflow.
                  The Dakota Fire Hole offers several advantages, including reduced visibility and efficient fuel consumption.
